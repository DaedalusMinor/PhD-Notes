- HLA-I and HLA-II peptides identification is increased more than two fold using timsTOF ([[Trapped Ion Mobility Spectrometry (TIMS)]])
- 50% increase in HLA-I peptides with:
	- different polygon placement
	- optimized ion accumulation
	- optimized collision energy (CE)
- 15000 distinct HLA-I and HLA-II peptides from 40 million cells by single-shot MS/MS
- >800 HLA-I peptides from 1mill cells
- Cancer-testis antigen (CTA) and novel unannotated ORFs (nuORF) HLA peptides detected from 1 mill cells or 15 mg tissues
	- CTA: family of tumor-associated antigens expressed in human tumors of a bunch of different types of cancers, but not in normal cells except for testis and placenta
	- nuORF
- timsTOF single cell proteomics (SCP) is compared against High-field asymmetric-waveform ion mobility spectrometry (FAIMS) (treated as sort of a control)
- chose single shot to limit sample handling
- [[Human Leukocyte Antigen (HLA)]] peptide prediction done through HLAthena
- tested a wide range of [[Precursor]] selection, accumulation time, and fragmentation patterns (Fig 1 B, C)
	- precursor filter: refines boundary of accepting ion mobility vs. mass/charge ratio pairs
		- found that including singly charged precursors improved results significantly
	- reducing collision energy was one of the main contributors to improvement
- A375 Melanoma Cells HLA I peptide count using SCP: ~17000
- pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) HLA I peptide count using SCP: ~15000
