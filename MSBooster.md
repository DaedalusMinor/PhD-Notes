Tool for rescoring [[Peptide Spectrum Matches (PSM)]] from MS/MS using additional deep learning features, such as [[Retention Time (RT)]], [[Ion Mobility (IM)]], and MS/MS spectra predictions.
- Positioned between [[MSFragger]] and [[Percolator]] within [[FragPipe]]
- role in fragpipe workflow
	- input file formatting for a DL model
	- feature calculation using observed and predicted peptide properties
	- addition of new features to PSM files
- In a typical workflow w/o MSBooster, search scores are stored for each PSM in a PIN file
	- MSBooster extracts peptides in this PIN file and uses them as input for a DL model
- [[DIA-NN]] predicts RT, IM, MS/MS properties and is chosen in Fragpipe to do this prediction (wait what??? so something like this already exists????)
- only does predictions for a small set of PSM candidates
- Passes results to [[Percolator]] which learns an SVM to differentiate decoys and targets
