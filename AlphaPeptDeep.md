 "A modular Python framework built on the PyTorch DL library that learns and predicts the properties of peptides ([https://github.com/MannLabs/alphapeptdeep](https://github.com/MannLabs/alphapeptdeep))"
 - Extensive use of transfer learning obviates the need for large data sets to refine models for particular experimental conditions
 - Predicting retention time, collisional cross sections and fragment intensities are at least on par with existing tools
 - Includes [[HLA]] peptide prediction model
