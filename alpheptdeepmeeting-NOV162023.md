- Use previous paper and prosit model to compare
- K-Fold learning:
	- parameters: num_split/model_split, 
		- split pepxml models
		- get n different models, trained on n-1 folds each
		- SpectraRT.csv: input file for alphapeptdeep, going to get split as well
		- provide spectraRTpredfile, mgf file
