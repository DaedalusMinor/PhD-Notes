- **Problem**: scoring methods for spectral searches include a lot of overlap between correct and incorrect peptides
	- **solution**: control the false discovery rate using decoys
	- ORRRR: use a machine learning method to re-rank the PSMs and set threshold automatically using reranked list
- PSM is associated with fixed length vector of features, weights learned from training
- improves peptide identification for searching methods like SEQUEST
- Problem with features that are specific for each experiment
	- unreasonable to train a new model for every single type of experiment
	- what do?: use semi-supervised approach
		- SVM learns difference between decoys and targets through 20 features
